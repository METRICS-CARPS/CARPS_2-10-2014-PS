## Article ID: 2-10-2014 PS

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Study 1 (and Table 1).

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for each measure
for Study 1.

> Participantsâ€™ Time 1 predictions of
their curiosity (M = 3.99, SD = 1.32) were lower than their actual curiosity ratings at Time 2, immediately before reading their responses (M = 4.34, SD = 1.25), t(105) = 2.88,
p = .005, d = 0.27. Participants also underestimated how
interesting they would find their responses. Predictions of
interest at Time 1 (M = 3.54, SD = 1.01) were lower than
ratings of actual interest experienced at Time 2 (M = 3.82,
SD = 0.89), t(105) = 3.10, p = .003, d = 0.29.
